Description: The Centric Systematic Area Sampling (CSAS) and the Simple Spatial 
    Survey Method (S3M) are spatial sampling methods adapted and used in health 
    and nutrition surveys by Brixton Health and Valid International. CSAS and 
    S3M are used in surveys designed to be spatially representative i.e., the 
    sample distributed evenly across the survey area, using a spatial sample 
    design that selected communities located closest to the centroids of a 
    square (for CSAS) or hexagonal (for S3M) grid laid over the survey area.
